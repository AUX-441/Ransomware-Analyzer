# Ransomware-Analyzer

Ransomware-Analyzer is a Python-based tool that simulates ransomware behavior for cybersecurity learning, testing, and research in a controlled environment. It encrypts and decrypts files in a target directory, allowing researchers and learners to study ransomware mechanisms safely.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Encrypts files in a specified folder using **Fernet symmetric encryption**.
- Supports **parallel encryption/decryption** using multithreading for efficiency.
- Fetches encryption keys via a **Telegram Bot** for secure key management.
- Provides an interactive **decryption prompt** for recovering files.
- Logs encryption/decryption events for tracking.
- Safe for testing in isolated environments only.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AUX-441/Ransomware-Analyzer.git
cd Ransomware-Analyzer
````

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up a Telegram Bot:

* Create a bot using [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
* Replace `BOT_TOKEN` in `Telegram_Bot.py` with your bot token.

---

## üìÇ Usage

1. Set the target folder to test encryption:

```python
TARGET_FOLDER = r"D:\11"  # Change to your test folder
```

2. Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. The script will:

* Wait for the encryption key from the Telegram Bot.
* Encrypt all files in the target folder.
* Optionally ask you to decrypt files using the key.
